# All Outta Bubblegum

This game is copyright 2001, Michael "Epoch" Sullivan and Jeffrey Grant.
If you want to repost it or whatever, drop me an email.

Characters in All Outta Bubblegum have one stat -- Bubblegum. It's
technically a number which varies from 0 through 8, though the designers
highly, highly recommend that you don't do anything so banal as write
down a number, and, instead, pass out actual sticks of bubblegum to the
players. This will also help when you play All Outta Bubblegum drunk,
which is, let's be blunt, probably the only time you'd even consider
playing this game.

Bubblegum always starts out at 8.

## Resolution

Any action which does not fall under the broad category of "kicking ass"
is resolved by rolling a d10. If the number rolled is equal to or less
than the amount of bubblegum the character has left, then the character
succeeds in his task.

Any action which falls under the broad umbrella of "kicking ass" is
also resolved by rolling a d10. However, in this case, you wish to roll
greater than the amount of bubblegum that you have left.

## Losing Bubblegum

Whenever you fail a non-combat roll, you lose a stick of Bubblegum.
You may also sacrifice a stick of Bubblegum before the roll to ensure
success.

Bubblegum also rates your damage. If someone else succeeds in a roll of
asskicking against you, you lose one stick of bubblegum.

## Zero Bubblegum

When you lose your last stick of bubblegum, you are officially
**all outta bubblegum**. You may no longer attempt any kind of
non-asskicking activity. Simple devices like, say, the handles of doors
confound you (eerily enough, you have no problem field-stripping a
.50 caliber machinegun to clear a jam in 15 seconds flat). However,
you automatically succeed in any asskicking-related activity. You are
a nearly unstoppable ball of bubblegum-less fury. When someone else
succeeds in an asskicking roll against you, they roll a d10. If they
roll a 10, you are knocked out. If they roll a 1 through 9, they've only
succeeded in making you, if possible, even more angry.

However, bear in mind that it's relatively easy to trap a zero-bubblegum
person in a situation he's totally incapable of dealing with.


There ya go. Think up your own damn adventures and campaign settings.
