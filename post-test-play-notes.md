Last modfied: 

* The biggest problem I had was that the players played very conservatively, and did not lose gum fast enough (or at all).
    * Should AOBG have free actions (like walking into an unlocked room)? I think maybe not. 
    * I think that it's kick-ass _or_ chew gum, so probably _every_ turn they need to roll once, either an ass-kick or a gum roll.
    * So maybe it's a kick-in-the-door either kick-ass or not, then see what's in the room
        * maybe every room should be locked?
        * but rooms that have a dwarf in them could be knocked on to open
    * Ask chatgpt about this
* More hints needed:
    * to try out the cat-o-nine tails, and realize it can herd cats
    * that the tools in the farm shop can be used to spay and neuter
    * Ask in the throne room about the key to the self-destruct room
    * Hints about putting together the flamethower
    * Hints about the cane toads (not everyone knows what cane toads are)
    * I think somehow you need to lay out a clear list of options: spay/neuter and/or, brutality + flamethrower, herding (magma or outside), cane toads. (or some combination)
    * (Maybe the first few dwarves should just be very talkative and drop a lot more hints quickly)
        * Maybe there are dwarves in the throne room presenting a list of options to the king
* Re-order the rooms
    * the farm workshop should come slightly later
    * re-order the rooms around revealing what is going on, rather than what makes sense for fotress construction.
* if you are going to say "pick ax" someone is going to take it. You need stats for it.
    * Probably it takes out a single cat, and is two-handed.
    * Mostly it's just useful for ass-kicking a door.
* Obviously, do a full re-read of the scenario
* Make a git repo, add a README:
    * That explains that the scenario has spoilers, so don't read if you want to _play_ it (give it to your DM)
    * That warns about animal cruelty, and that it could be challenging for some people to play.
    * That it is a test of humanity: they will face a challenge with no right answer, but something _has_ to be done
