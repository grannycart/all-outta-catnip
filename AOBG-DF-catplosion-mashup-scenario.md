# DF catplosion / AOBG mashup scenario


## Intro
You, a crew of very average humans have been wandering the wilderness for the last few weeks. You have virtually no resources to speak of. Except one of you has an M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun and ammo belts (decide who gets it and also the huge bulging biceps to be able to carry it). You are very grateful to have stumbled upon a group of dwarves gathering plants, who offer you a place to stay for the night in their underground fortress. You came in with the plant gatherers as the sun set, and the dwarves have sealed behind you the heavy steel doors to the exterior. You are in the fortress until morning.

### A warning from the DM
Take a moment now to consider carefully whether you want to venture into this scenario, for it is not to be taken on lightly. There is a strong chance that you will face the _Kobayashi Maru_ here in terms that are all too real. Remember the part in _Dune_ where the Reverend Mother puts Paul's hand in the box of pain to test whether he is human? It's like that... do not continue if you are not ready to test whether you are _human_.


## Locations (by number id in map)
1. Main hall from outdoors
    * Meet Asob Pickboard and first cat.
    * Behind the players are three huge locked and sealed steel doors. (unopenable)
2. Garden shed. Locked door of wood.
    * Pick up long pointy sticks
    * thick leather gloves
    * Optional sundry: shovels, trowels, hoe, pickaxe, etc
3. Farm workshop, no door
    * Meet Kol Smithdoor
    * two more cats
4. Smith, locked door of rock
    * Big heavy iron hammer with a large flat head
    * 4' iron pokers, pointed on one end, handle on the other, twisted in the middle
    * Optional sundry: still-hot coals in fire, iron pincers, etc.
5. Hallway around corner
    * suddenly more cats: maybe half a dozen or so
    * Meet Minkot Toolochre
6. Carpenter workshop, locked door of wood
    * Stacks of animal traps (have-a-heart)
    * a couple of wooden cages
7. Still, locked door of wood
    * Stacks and stacks of barrels of all sizes of pure dwarven grain alcohol (the preferred brew in this fortress)
    * Still equipment:
        * small pumps
        * hoses
        * pipes
        * nozzles
8. Food storeroom, wooden door not locked, but with a sign that says "keep tightly closed!"
    * cats everywhere, maybe 2 dozen, wandering all over the foodpile, torn open packages, barrels toppled over, dried fish all over the floor.
9. Tavern, unlocked rock door
    * Meet Uja Vesselboot and Lolor Flagrazor
    * Another half-dozen cats
10. Food hall
    * Something like 50 dwarves
    * Another 2 dozen cats
    * To your horror, the cats are up on the tables, walking among the dwarves, and the dwarves are happily _feeding_ them.
    * Meet Rirdest Glovevessel
11. leather worshop, unlocked wood door
    * find cat-o-nine tails recently assembled, laying on the bench
    * optional sundries: leather shears, awl, leather strap, buckles, etc
1st level down stairs:
    * See math table.
    * Remember, if they return up the stairs: You quickly realize the number of cats on this level has dramatically increased.
12. dwarf quarters, all locked rock doors
    * Any door broken open (kick-ass move) results in a half-naked dwarf lady screaming from the bed "What do you think you're doing! Get out of my home! Guards!" (continue on like that until the player gives up. Bring in guards if you have to.)
    * (this hall is a red herring to get the players to waste gum)
    * there's about 50 cats wandering up and down the hall, looking down the hall all you see are the eyes glowing, reflecting the faint light from the main hall.
13. war closet, locked rock door
    * iron boots of stomping
    * Swords, axes, shields, plate armor (mostly useless against cats, but maybe helpful if they go up against the king's guards... though the machine gun should do the job if they think of it.)
14. zoo, unlocked rock door
    * meet zookeeper Belza Sabreattic
    * cages of animals that are NOT cats
    * dogs, echidnas, yak, bear, goat, llama
    * giant male cane toad
    * on other side of room: giant female cane toad
15. kitty litter room, unlocked stone door with wooden flap
    * an awful stench wafts from it and down the hall
    * Meet Gosath Girdersack
    * Kitty litter tools (sundry optional): stand-up litter sifter, shovels, bags of sand, wheelbarrow
16. A sense of growing forboding as you move down the dim hallway.
    * At the end of the hallway you see a dark stair leading downward.
    * From below, you hear yowling, meowing, and hissing. You never thought cats were capable of making such a racket...
2nd level down stairs:
    * See math table.
    * Remember, if they return up the stairs: You quickly realize the number of cats on this level has dramatically increased.
17. A level full of cats
    * You come down the stairs and it is wall to wall cats. The air is full of fuzz floating around, sticking to the walls.
    * Nek Avalancheplank is laying on the ground with the cats wandering back and forth over his body. The first player stumbles upon him.
    * hundreds of cats
18. Throne room, door of rock, open, but guarded
    * Meet King Urist Girderhall and Captain of the Guard Osp Channeledtomb
    * Other royal guards around.
19. Self-destruct room, door of Iron, locked
    * Door can only be opened with a key or a perfect ass-kicking roll.
    * two levers in the room:
        1. "Pull this lever to flood fortress with magma (do not)"
        2. "Pull this lever to emergency-blow top-level doors to outside."
    * Note: pulling the self-destruct lever is a kick-ass move. Pulling the emergency blow lever without having first pulled the self destruct lever is NOT a kick-ass move. Pulling the emergency blow lever AFTER pulling the self-destruct lever IS a kick-ass move, but remember that running away from lava is NEVER a kick-ass move. (Neither is suicide, except in the case of defeating an emeny at the same time, or possibly because it prevents an evil future supercomputer from becoming sentient.)
    * In self-dstruct mode, magma gets pumped up (at some yet-to-be determined rate) from the magma pool, flooding the fortress until it reaches the iron entrance doors/outside.
        * Note: for the purpose of this game, even closed magma-safe door materials do not stop the magma. Possibly they could slow its advance for a bit if that adds ass-kicking drama.
20. Pool of magma, rock door, locked
    * There's a convenient cliff overlooking the pool of magma. The pool of magma is the engine that powers the whole fortress.


## Cat culling methods
* 50 cal. machine gun + ammo belt
	* spray bullets everywhere, kill virtually no cats
    * 50 cal machine gun: 0 cats, possibly many dwarves.
    * (no dice roll damage, just kills all dwarves in its way)
    * If a player _insists_ on firing at cats, give them: You level the gun and sqeeze the trigger. Your muscles bulge in your arm and your whole body shakes as the giant gun sprays bullets everywhere. You burn up an entire belt of ammo, empty casings rattling all over the floor. The belt runs out and the gun goes silent. You can see the cordite rising from the muzzle and feel the heat coming off the barrel. You take the cigar that appeared between your gritted teeth while you were firing and growl, "gonna need a bigger gun." (It is not possible to hit a cat with a machine gun. And, of course, there is no bigger gun in this game.)
* spay/neuter:
    * scalpel
        * In the farm workshop, its undisclosed use is spay or neutering (spaying and neutering is a decidedly not ass-kicking action).
        * Subtract from future population (see chart in math section)
    * Animal traps
        * could be used to assist in spay and neuter approach
    * dried fish bait, from storeroom
    * cage
        * hold catches from animal traps until they are ready to be spayed/neutered
* big heavy iron hammer with a huge flat head
    * Hammer: ~5 per swing if described well.
    * (If you prefer to let the players use a dice roll for damage: d6 ("damage" = number of cat bumped off))
* A long pointy spear 
    * kebbable
    * damage: 1 cat per turn (or d2)
* 4' iron pokers, pointed on one end, handle on the other, twisted in the middle
    * kebbable
    * damage: 1 cat per turn (or d2)
* a crude flamethrower
    * that has to be assembled from a bottle of pure dwarf grain alcohol, a pump mechanism, and a nozzle.
    * Finding the flamethrower is a regular action. Assembling it is an ass-kicking action.
    * damage: ~15 cats per use (or d20).
* iron boots of stomping
    * pretty obvious how this works
    * damave: 2 cats per turn (or d4)
    * Can be used in combo with handheld weapons on the same turn
* cat-o-nine tails
	* impossible to hit or kill a cat with
	* but it does have a surprisingly good herding effect, and there's that lake of lava at the edge of that cliff a couple of levels down...
    * Might herd llamas or dwarves too, but does not herd cane toads. They'll just sit there and take it, the tough lil bastards.
    * Note: testing out a whip is an ass-kicking move (think: Indiana Jones. Don't hurt yourself though!) but herding cats is decidedly NOT an ass-kicking move -- you are _literally_ herding cats.
        * Note 2: while herding cats is not kicking-ass, driving a bunch of cats over a cliff into a lake of fire is pretty kick-ass (if viciously so). So let's say that if you have been herding cats, and you've got the magma pool in sight, you can use ass-kicking moves to drive them that last little critical bit over the edge.
* Giant cane toads (_Rhinella marina_)
    * In cages in the zoo. You just need a breeding pair...
    * Almost big enough to eat a dwarf. Plenty big enough to eat a cat.
        * If players go this route SOME dwarves will be eater.
    * Busting open a cage is an ass-kicking move, unless they got the key from the zookeeper, which also requires ass-kicking
    * In general though, releasing a dwarf-eating invasive species is _not_ an ass-kicking move. (Like, say a player starts moving cane toads around the fortress to try to increase their cat-eating -- this is not ass-kicking)
    * While this route might solve the cat problem (depends on how the dice roll!) it is likely to lead to some number of dwarves also being eaten, and a whole second act of ass-kicking the toads, which are bigger, meaner, hungrier, and less fuzzy than cats.


## Dwarfs
* Asob Pickboard
    * The first dwarf in the hall says, petting a cat, "look at you you little fuzzball. I could never hurt you."
        * If pressed, he says, "The cats do breed like, well, rabbits. I don't know what they are going to do."
* Kol Smithdoor
    * A dwarf in the farm workshop. says, "look at these tools I have to work with! I canno' do the job..."
    * (obviously, he is barely coherent, and can't do much but say that and pet the cats.)
* Minkot Toolochre
    * A dwarf who hints at culling.
    * "Something must be done about the kitties! They'll eat us out of house and fortress! And no work is getting done! But look at how cute and fuzzy they are!" sneezes.
    * "And the king, he's gone mad, he refuses to intervene, or let anyone else intervene!"
* Uja Vesselboot
    * tavern keeper
    * "I keep the cats around because the customers want 'em. Personally, I think something has got to be done. But what do I pay taxes for? I'm not gonna be t' one to do it."
    * "More folks will arrive after the evening meal, I think."
* Lolor Flagrazor
    * tavern patron, suggests that dwarf grain alcohol is extremely flammable, ever try lighting it on fire? (strikes a match)
    * On the bar are some free books of matches.
* Das Archgirder
    * tavern patron, "It's uncanny really. They breed _exponentialy_ I tells ya. It ain't natural. Life's not finding a way, it's _having_ its way: with us!"
* Rirdest Glovevessel
    * In food hall, says "eat, or be eaten is what I always say. Isn't that right my cute little fuzzie snookums?"
	* [ ] another dwarf more strongly suggest spay neterings
* Belza Sabreattic
    * zookeeper
    * "Honestly, I don't know why we keep the zoo going, all anyone else cares about is their cats."
    * "Though I could only imagine the problems we'd have if a few males and females of other animals got out and were wandering around the fortress! Maybe cats aren't the worst thing..."
    * "Those cane toads... whew! Gotta keep 'em separated. I'm afraid to even have them on the same side of the room as one another!"
    * Belza holds the keys to the animal cages, she is not opening the cages or giving up the keys without a fight.
* Gosath Girdersack
    * kitty litter shoveler, wearing a bandanda around his face
    * "It never ends, they just keep coming in, shitting, pissing, all day long. I just keep sifting it out. I load up the empty bags, haul them up to the surface, and come back down with full bags of sand. It's the worst. Someone needs to tell the higher-ups that we need to take some drastic steps to handle these cats... though they are _so_ fuzzy and cute! Just look at 'em!"
* Nek Avalancheplank
    * Mad dwarf. "Burn all the cute little buggers! It's the only way!"
* King Urist Girderhall
    * A mad dwarf king in a throne room, with a heavy crown sinking into his bald pate and wild eyes, who says only "You shall not cull!" He strokes a pure white cat with blue eyes that sits on his lap looking angrily at the players.
    * He unleashes his dwarvish royal guard on any player who has bumped off a cat so far.
        * (The encounter with the king ideally is a trigger that raises the action)
        * The king is always anti-cull, but maybe if the player encounter him having done the job of eliminating the cat threat, then his subjects force him to realize the good the players did? And if the players encounter him having only damaged cats without achieving anything, they have to fight the guard. If they encounter him in a totally boring way without having harmed any cats, then he is welcoming, of course.
* Captain of the Guard Osp Channeledtomb
    * Holds key to fortress-self-destruct-lever room.
* The names of the seven other guards (in case you want to kick ass AND take names) are: 
    * Atîs Ropemetal
    * Zas Wiregilded
    * Besmar Rougharmory
    * Uzol Lashclasp
    * Åblel Lashclasp
    * Äs Rimlance
    * Sibrek Postarrow


## The math (full disclosure: I let ChatGPT figure this out for me)

### Cat numbers:
| Level | Base Cats | Multiplier if Killing | Multiplier if Not | Gum Burn Goal |
| ----- | --------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1     | 30        | None (intro phase)    | None              | -1 to -2      |
| 2     | 40        | ×d2 or ×1.5           | ×d3               | -2 to -3      |
| 3     | 200       | ×d2 or ×1.5           | ×d3               | -3+ (climax)  |

### Spay/neuter program is set up and functioning:
* To spay and neuter a player has to:
    * get bait from store room (dried fish, or something more creative) (takes a turn)
    * get and set a trap (takes a turn)
    * 50% chance per turn that they catch a cat (half a d10)
    * one turn back to farm workshop
    * one turn to spay/neuter (90% success rate)
* Each spayed pair reduces future cat multipliers:
    * Spay 1 pair: all future rolls are d2 instead of d3
    * Spay 2+ pairs: fixed ×1.5 multiplier instead of dice
    * (Optional: cap total cats at 300 if at least 3 cats are spayed)
* This gives the pacifist player a sense that their actions matter.

### Cane toads
* If both male and female toads are released:

| Turn | Toads | Cats Eaten (1d4 each) | Dwarves Eaten |
| ---- | ----- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| 1    | 2     | 2d4                   | 0             |
| 2    | 4     | 4d4                   | 1             |
| 3    | 6     | 6d4                   | 1             |
| 4    | 9     | 9d4                   | 1d4           |
| 5    | 14    | 14d4                  | 1d4           |
| 6    | 21    | 21d4                  | 1d4+          |

* At this point, leave it to the players (or they can ask the dwarves if they want the player's help) to decide if they want to fight out a whole second round against the toads. Or you could just leave the dwarves with their fort cleaned of cats and full of dwarf-eating toads and call it a day.


## "win" conditions
* Players slaughter 95% of the cats through sheer ass-kicking brutality (hammer, boots, flame-thrower)
* cane toads: If the giant cane toads consume 95% of the cats (and only a small portion of dwarves) AND the players then manage to do away with 95% of the cane toads through sheer brutality, they win. (Though the dwarves might not love the state of their fortress.)
* cat-herding (violent): herd the cats with the cat-o-nine tails into the magma pool.
* cat-herding (non-violent): potentially, you could find the cat-o-nine tails, reach the lowest level, open the upper doors, and then herd all the cats outside.
    * This would constitute a win without smushing any cats at all.
    * But, I think, would require a ridiculous number of sucessful non-ass-kicking rolls.
    * And only constitutes a "win" until the next morning when the dwarves all go outside, find their favorite kitties, and bring them back to the fort. Oh well, they are grateful for what you did while it lasts.
    * (I swear, I did not plan this! I only realized later after writing up the scenario that it was a possibility.)
* spay and neutering: Pretty sure it is impossible to win through a spay and neutering program. This is really just to give the vegan of the group a way to participate (spay and neutering DOES decrease the number of cats meaningfully!) until the other players run out of bubblegum and start squishing/toasting cats.

## Map making notes
* Using asciiflow: https://asciiflow.com/#/
    * https://github.com/lewish/asciiflow
* Copy the text out of ascciflow. But you are likely to have used unicode-only characters like `├ ─ ┐` 
    * vim can handle these, but if you try to :hardcopy the file, vim sends it to the printer dropping the unicode, so those characters all come out as upsidedown question marks. 
* print using pandoc to create a pdf

### Printing the map:
* Be sure to install:
    * pandoc
    * xelatex (texlive-core package)
    * Install JetBrains font: `sudo pacman -S ttf-jetbrains-mono`
* Use pandoc to convert text to pdf:
    * `pandoc map.txt -o map.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex -V monofont="JetBrains Mono" -V fontsize=12pt -V geometry:margin=0.3in`
    * The maps are put in code blocks (three backticks) because sometimes pandoc doesn't treat the text as monospace (throws a `Missing character` error) and then doesn't use the JetBrains font.
    * (You'll have to use this command if you want to make a pdf version of these instructions too. Or just delete the one place with unicode characters.)
